# pomodoro-timer
## Project Overview
This project is done using Java, using Timer Objects from the Java utils library. Eventually I'll also be using JPanels and hopefully also be running the program in the System Tray to have some more attractive popups.
## Project Goals
This project is something that I'll be working on in any down-time during my studies. The main goal for me in this project is to learn some of the following concepts in functional programming

### Timer Objects and Task Scheduling
Using Timer objects to schedule tasks to be run at a later time (opening a popup) and how to cancel this task if the user chooses to

### JUnit Unit Tests
I'd like to get some more practical experience in writing some appropriate JUnit tests to test that my program is operating as expected

### Github Issues
I plan to utilise Issues to write User Stories when I want to implement some extra features

### JPanels / UI Design
I plan to use JPanels to create a Functional User Interface and pop-ups to display information to the user, and then edit these to make theme more attractive and user-friendly
